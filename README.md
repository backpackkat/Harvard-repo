All my work (Labs, Problem Sets & Challenges) completed as a part of my post-graduate work attending Harvard University, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences
[https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/syllabus/].

**#Syllabus:**
Topics included abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. 
Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. 
Course culminated in a final project/thesis. 

**#Expectations:**
You are expected to
-submit 10 problem sets,
-submit 9 labs, and
-submit a final project.

**Total # of Projects Completed: 37**
**Difficulty level: Harder option chosen for each lab and Problem Set.**

**- I received 100% on all my Lab/PSet submissions and grades.**

**#Certificates:**
You must receive a satisfactory score (at least 70%) on each problem you submit as part of one of the course’s ten problem sets as well as on the course’s final project in order o be eligible for a verified certificate.  

**#Lectures:**
The course’s lectures introduce each week’s concepts. *(HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED; David is an incredible teacher to learn from!)*

**#Labs:**
Labs are programming exercises that prepare you for the week’s problem set.

**#Problem Sets:**
Problem sets are programming assignments. Harvard does not have deadlines for problem sets.  You are welcome to work on and submit them at your own pace. To be eligible for a verified certificate, however, you must submit (and receive a score of at least 70% on) all problem sets and labs

**Note: The amount of work (Required Labs/Problem Sets & how much time is required) varies from week to week. Don't assume that because you had a heavier or lighter week previously that next week will be the same!**

**#Walkthroughs:**
Integrated into problem sets are “walkthroughs,” videos that offer direction on where to begin and how to approach problems.

**Grading:**
Problems and labs are evaluated along axes of correctness and style, with scores ordinarily computed as 3 × correctness + 1 × style.

**- I received 100% on all my submissions and grades.**


**#Final Project:**
The climax of this program is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. You may implement your project in any language(s). You are welcome to utilize infrastructure other than the Codespace. All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact your community, or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.

Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two classmates for this final project. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that group’s project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person group’s project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person project. A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course’s problem sets. Although no more than three students may design and implement a given project, you are welcome to solicit advice from others, so long as you respect the course’s policy on academic honesty.

Harvard does not have a deadline for the final project. You are welcome to work on and submit it at your own pace. To be eligible for a verified certificate, however, you must submit (and receive a score of at least 70%). 

**#Final Thoughts:**
**Remember to budget enough time for your Final Project - it takes a lot longer than any other Lab or P Set.**

**The program has 11 "weeks" of study material, but took me approx. 7 months of concentrated daily effort to finish the program (can't rush learning!). You make your own schedule. (So you have to be disciplined.) My learning has been exponential, especially the last 4 weeks of curricula. Felt like I was standing in front of a firehose the last few months (and I don’t want anyone to turn it off, ever again).**
