All my work (Labs, Problem Sets & Challenges) completed as a part of my post-graduate work attending Harvard University, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

## **Syllabus:**
Topics included abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. 
Languages include C, Python, Flask, SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. 
Program culminated in a final project/thesis. 

## *# Expectations:**
You are expected to
-submit 10 problem sets,
-submit 9 labs, and
-submit a final project.
- Total: 37 programs created.

## **Total # of Projects Completed: 37**
## **Difficulty level: Harder option chosen for each lab and Problem Set.**

## **- I received 100% on all my Lab/PSet submissions and grades.**

## **#Lectures:**
The course’s lectures introduce each week’s concepts. *(HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED; David is an incredible teacher to learn from!)*

## **#Labs:**
Labs are programming exercises that prepare you for the week’s problem set.

## **#Problem Sets:**
Problem sets are programming assignments. Harvard does not have deadlines for problem sets.  You are welcome to work on and submit them at your own pace. To be eligible for a verified certificate, however, you must submit (and receive a score of at least 70% on) all problem sets and labs

## **Note: The amount of work (Required Labs/Problem Sets & how much time is required) varies from week to week. Don't assume that because you had a heavier or lighter week previously that next week will be the same!**
## **Grading:**
Problems and labs are evaluated along axes of correctness and style, with scores ordinarily computed as 3 × correctness + 1 × style.

## **- I received 100% on all my submissions and grades.**

#### **#Final Thoughts:**
**Remember to budget enough time for your Final Project - it takes a lot longer than any other Lab or P Set.**

**The program has 11 "weeks" of study material, but took me approx. 7 months (2 yrs total) of concentrated daily effort to finish the program (can't rush learning!). You make your own schedule. (So you have to be disciplined.) My learning has been exponential, especially the last 4 weeks of curricula. Felt like I was standing in front of a firehose the last few months (and I don’t want anyone to turn it off, ever again).**
